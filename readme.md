Syncing with Gitlab to auto push and deploy a new version.
That also means if I push to gitlab, I also get an auto sync!

I can also sync it to a branch called writing, to have a PR to push out the publication. But now it syncs automatically to master, which means a new deploy

Run `hugo server -w` to have development version of this.

# Deployment
Just sync with master on gitlab, it is beeing hosted on pages on gitlab.

# Bucket for pictures
